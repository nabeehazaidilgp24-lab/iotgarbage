This project is a smart IoT-enabled garbage bin that uses an ultrasonic sensor connected to a Wemos D1 Mini ESP32 to detect when trash is placed in the bin. The sensor emits sound waves and measures the distance to an object in front of it; if the distance is below a set threshold, the Wemos considers the bin “full” and sets a value of 1, otherwise it sets 0. This value is sent through D2 to the NinjaIoT cloud, which updates a field representing the bin’s status. A simple HTML dashboard fetches the D2 field from the cloud and displays the real-time status, showing “Full/Object Detected” when the value is 1 and “Empty” when the value is 0, allowing users to monitor the bin online.
